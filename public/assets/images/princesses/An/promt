Final AI Instructions:
"Generate a full-body image of a 26-year-old Spanish princess with a very thin build. She is standing in a palace garden, with her entire body clearly visible from head to toe. Her face is asymmetrical, with prominent cheekbones, a large nose, and small, droopy eyes. Her skin is pale and uneven, with visible pores and scars. She has thin, disheveled hair with a tiara that looks like she is wearing an overly richly colored royal gown and a large, unbalanced crown; despite her unattractive appearance, she carries herself with dignity and grace.

The image should be highly detailed, with cinematic lighting, natural shadows, and warm, realistic skin tones. Use a harmonious color palette, and make sure the background (palace garden, throne room, or flower meadow) is richly detailed and complements her figure. Focus on full-body composition, ensuring that her entire body is visible and well proportioned in the frame."
