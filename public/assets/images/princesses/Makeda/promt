"Create a realistic, highly detailed portrait of an African princess from a cannibal tribe. She is of the Negroid race, with very dark, almost black skin that has a smooth and shiny texture. Her face is symmetrical, with high cheekbones, a broad forehead, and a large, prominent nose that is typical of African features. Her eyes are large and black, with long, natural eyelashes, radiating wisdom and strength.

She has long, straight black hair, either flowing down her shoulders or styled in an intricate tribal hairstyle, decorated with wooden or bone accessories, feathers, and beads. Her body is average, slightly overweight, with wide hips, long limbs, and graceful movements. Her skin is covered with traditional tribal tattoos or scarification marks, symbolizing her status and heritage. Her thighs are athletic and muscular, and she wears gold or copper bracelets on her ankles.

She wears traditional clothing made of animal skins and natural fabrics, decorated with tribal ornaments and symbols. Her dress is simple but dignified, reaching the ground, and is adorned with feathers, beads, and other tribal elements. On her head, she wears a crown or headdress made of wood, bones, and precious stones, emphasizing her status as a princess.

The background is the main focus, depicting a tribal village with huts made of mud and straw, ritual fires, and tribal warriors. The atmosphere is dramatic and mysterious, emphasizing the princess's grace and nobility despite the harsh traditions of her tribe.

The image should be photorealistic, with a focus on intricate details, natural lighting, and a harmonious color palette of dark browns, blacks, and earthy tones. Avoid any cartoonish, stylized, or non-African features, aiming for a lifelike, cinematic representation of a purely African Negroid woman."
