Create a realistic, highly detailed portrait of a 40-year-old princess standing in a grand palace hall. She has dark auburn hair, styled elegantly, and extremely dark blue eyes that radiate depth and wisdom. Her face is mature yet graceful, with soft features and a confident, slightly smiling expression.

Her body has a medium build, with wide hips and very small breasts, giving her a balanced and natural appearance. She wears a luxurious royal gown made of velvet or silk, adorned with intricate embroidery, golden threads, and subtle gemstones. The gown is floor-length, with a fitted bodice and a flowing skirt that emphasizes her figure.

The background is a grand palace hall, with ornate decorations, golden chandeliers, large windows letting in natural light, and elegant furniture. The atmosphere is regal and serene, with a focus on the princess's grace and maturity.

The image should be photorealistic, with a focus on intricate details, natural lighting, and a harmonious color palette of deep reds, blues, and golds. Avoid any cartoonish or stylized elements, aiming for a lifelike, cinematic representation of a mature and elegant princess."
